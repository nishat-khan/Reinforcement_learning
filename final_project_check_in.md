- Name(s): Nishat Parveen Mehboob Khan
- Finalized Research Question (1): Can an RL algorithm be used for making better self-driving cars?
- The following working code in GitHub (3): 
    - An environment: simple road with car in one lane and pedestrian 
    - An agent that performs random actions in the environment (1) 
    - An agent that learns based on the environment (1)
- List of ideas to finish project (1):
    - Tried Q-learning
    - Next plan is to try Deep Q-Network
